Git LFS is a system for managing and versioning large files in
association with a Git repository.  Instead of storing the large files
within the Git repository as blobs, Git LFS stores special "pointer
files" in the repository, while storing the actual file contents on a
Git LFS server.  The contents of the large file are downloaded
automatically when needed, for example when a Git branch containing
the large file is checked out.

Git LFS works by using a "smudge" filter to look up the large file
contents based on the pointer file, and a "clean" filter to create a
new version of the pointer file when the large file's contents change.
It also uses a pre-push hook to upload the large file contents to
the Git LFS server whenever a commit containing a new large file
version is about to be pushed to the corresponding Git server.
