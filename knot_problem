In Knot theory knot is as any other knot with its end closed.
Challenges - 
    Same number of crossings in a knot may have completely different structure, which are not 
    interchangeable. 
    This number of differnet structure for same no of crossings is diffcult to crack, somewhere
    till now only for number of crossings=8-10, no of different structure have been explored.

Recenty - Slice of Convway knot problem was solved by mathematician.
    Left to figure out -> conway knot & slice of it.
    Conway knot is a knot with 11 crossings.
